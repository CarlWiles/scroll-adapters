# Protocol Checklist

Welcome! Thank you for submitting a PR with your protocol data. The [README](../README.md) should serve as a general guide for you. But please follow this checklist to ensure you have everything.

- [ ] Read the [README](../README.md) and explore the other adapters (see `adapters/example`)
- [ ] See the schema that we are requesting based on your protocol type (currently supporting, lending and perps)
- [ ] Submit a PR with progress with a new folder containing your adapter (in `adapter/{protocol-name}`)
- [ ] Build your adapter
  - [ ] Ensure your `package.json` has a `start` command that executes the proper code
  - [ ] Follow the schema/output format, standard input file format, and standard function inputs
  - [ ] Ensure the adapter runs and executes in the proper workflow (see: `How to execute this project?` in [README](../README.md))
- [ ] QA your data
- [ ] Notify our team when you are ready for a review!
